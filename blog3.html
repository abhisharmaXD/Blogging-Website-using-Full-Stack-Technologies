                <h3>YouTube is one of the greatest websites out there. There are millions of people who visit YouTube every day. Having all those people in one spot makes it a gold mine for internet marketers. For bloggers, it can be a great source of free website traffic.</h3>
                <h3>Because YouTube is now owned by Google, having quality, high ranking YouTube videos is a great way to get targeted visitors to check out your site. You’ve probably seen at least one or two YouTube videos pop up on your Google search for a, particularly competitive keyword.</h3>
                <h3>An official YouTube channel for your blog is kind of like a video page for your site. Not only can you customize it according to the look and feel of your site, but you can drive insane amounts of traffic from a global audience.</h3>
                <h2>Here Are Quick Tips For Increasing YouTube Traffic…</h2>
                <h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Spread your videos to as many websites as possible. An easy way to do this is when you are done publishing a video on YouTube, create a blog post and embed the video on your website.</li>
                        <li>Like a normal blog post, it’s important that your YouTube video also gets social signals. Share and submit your videos to popular social media and bookmarking sites like Twitter, Google Plus, Facebook, Digg, etc. You can also share your videos on fan pages, and ask users to comment on and like your videos.</li>
                        <li>Creating a video is not enough. You also need to make it look good. You should use video editing tools or hire a video editor to add some professional touches to your videos.</li>
                        <li>A video without good audio is as useless as a chocolate teapot. Ensure the audio quality is good. Depending upon the kind of video you creating, use quality audio equipment. Most of the pro users who make videos from home use something like a Blue Yeti Mic or some other podcasting mic. Here’s a good rule of thumb: The audio is the most important part of a video.</li>
                        <li>Try to keep the videos you create “clean” without too much (or any) controversial material; but if your niche deals with controversy (eg politics, celebrity gossip, etc.), then it’s better to be very controversial.</li>
                        <li>Embed your logo and website URL into the video somehow. You can do this with text at the end or beginning, or by including your logo and URL throughout the entire video.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you have a good camera and good editing equipment. If you don’t want to sink the money into these things, consider hiring a professional. But if you keep hiring people, it’ll probably end up costing more than just buying the equipment in the first place.</li>
                        <li>Think about overall colour schemes. Some videos may record in a yellow or red hue. This can subliminally affect a viewer’s opinions. Pay attention to the final colour scheme.</li>
                        <li>Be yourself. Do not lose sight of the purpose and mission of the video. Loosen up when speaking. Be relaxed, confident, and genuine. Viewers trust people who can be authentic.</li>
                        <li>Stick to a schedule if you record a series, otherwise, people will just give up on the videos. Be sure to release the next videos in the series on schedule.</li>
                        <li>If people put negative comments on your video, ignore them. By “feeding the trolls” you are encouraging their bad behavior and you might say something you regret later on. Enable comment moderation for uploaded videos, and accept genuine and meaningful comments to maintain the comment quality on your YouTube channels.</li>
                        <li>Utilize as many places as you can to embed your video… like your blog, Google Plus, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Digg, etc. Promote these videos like a proper article.</li>
                        <li>Upload live webcam videos. Have a webcam located at your office, or wherever, and then upload these videos onto your YouTube channel. It’s a fun way to get others involved in the day to day operations of what you are doing.</li>
                        <li>Specify your channel type, and have a clear sense of what you’re offering on the channel’s main page.</li>
                        <li>Make a channel and user profile. This gives viewers a home base to look at your videos and check for any new ones.</li>
                        <li>Stick to your target audience. Don’t try to branch out too far from your purpose, or you could easily lose loyal followers.</li>
                        <li>Watch others and learn. By viewing other videos that are related to your business, you can get a feel for what other people are doing, and what others are saying about them.</li>
                        <li>Aside from your logo and website, including a way for people to contact you via email.</li>
                        <li>You can release more than one video at once. If you have several videos ready to go, don’t be afraid to let them go all at the same time.</li>
                        <li>Write the script in advance. While impromptu videos are fun, it’s really easy to mess up the vision when you improvise.</li>
                        <li>Use analytic tools like YouTube’s Insight to track your sources and hits.</li>
                        <li>Choose your thumbnail wisely. YouTube actually lets users choose their thumbnails, so do it carefully and thoughtfully.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>YouTube, as I’m sure you know, is a very high-traffic website. If you learn how to utilize it correctly, you can drive huge amounts of traffic to your website.</h3>
