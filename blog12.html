                <h1><u>Why People Blog</u></h1>
                <img src="/images/Why-Do-People-Blog.jpg" alt="Why-Do-People-Blog" style="width: 40%;">
                <h3>Blogs today have become an essential part and needed for most of the generation worldwide. It’s raining blogs. Life was never so tech savvy before this. Whether one needs advice, needs to share a personal experience, be aware of the views on any topic, all one needs is to gear up and punch in a few keys and write a blog.</h3>
                <h3>With the birth of blogs, conventional writing has taken a back seat. Ink is replaced by the keyboard and readers are targeted globally. Blogging gets you the reactions from worldwide. It provides a place to say it and be heard. In general, ‘blog’ used to mean a personal online diary, typically concerned with boyfriend problems or techie news.</h3>
                <h3>The blog now refers to a Web journal that comments on the news — often by criticizing the media and usually in rudely clever tones — with links to stories that back up the commentary with evidence.</h3>
                <h2>Reasons people write blogs:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3><li><strong>To Share Knowledge</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/knowledge-sharing-across-internal-teams.png" alt="knowledge-sharing-across-internal-teams">
                    <h3>A lot of individuals start a blog to share their knowledge, Especially the curious types, as they understand the knowledge they have is precious, and they should document and share the same. And it makes sense, as one also learns more by teaching. Since blogging requires you to research more, and come up with the best version of your knowledge.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>Hobby/Interest in Writing</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/Interest-in-Writing.jpg" alt="Interest-in-Writing">
                    <h3>This is the most common reason people blog. Many people like to write and they like to write for themselves. Basically, this is what blogging is all about. It’s why blogging started, and it’s why blogging exists. Most people just want to keep an online space for writing. These people don’t care about the best blogging platforms, how to get more traffic, and how to increase the number of comments. They just love to write, and if someone comments, then hey, that’s good too. That said, blogging out of passion should be every blogger’s biggest reason for blogging.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>Networking</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/Networking_image.jpg " alt="Networking_image">
                    <h3>It’s a great way of meeting new people, globally or locally.  Blogging helps to spread ideas and connections beyond geographical boundaries. It is one of the best way to connect with like-minded people, and also share your thinking about certain issues. The comment section of a blog is gold mine, where you also get to hear others opinion, point of view on the topic you are writing on. What could be the better way to connect then talking about common interest with a stranger?</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>Digital Nomad lifestyle</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/Untitled_Artwork-81-1.jpeg" alt="Untitled_Artwork-81-1">
                    <h3>Digital nomadic lifestyle is not an unfamiliar concept, and a lot of individuals like to travel the world and work. Blogging is something which gives you this opportunity, as you can work from anywhere at your pace.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>For making money</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/Money.jpg" alt="money">
                    <h3>Most people look at professional bloggers think, “Oh, all I have to do is write a few things, click a few buttons, and I can make a lot of money!” But this is very, very, very untrue. Blogging can be a gold mine for people who want to tap into the rich field of online marketing, but if you just want to make money, you’ll make more money at a “traditional” job. If you do want to make money blogging, you should have a well-planned road map for your blog, and be able to target a profitable niche.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>Advertising and Branding</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/iStock-902673692-724x358.jpg" alt="iStock-902673692-724x358">
                    <h3>Since the enormous part of the population is internet friendly, a lot of companies see it as a profitable exercise to blog and advertise their company. Through the blogs, they can also get reviews on their products and hence test the waters. It’s a great platform for the branding of the products. You can talk about your products and its features, how it works etc. Inform the readers about the new products that are to be launched in the future and answer their query on the same.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>To connect with like-minded people</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/attachment_6157664.jfif" alt="attachment_6157664" style="width: 30%;">
                    <h3>Blogging helps to bring in together the people who think alike. When you blog on a certain topic. Sometimes they help you to take your thoughts forward. Through blogs a lot of idea sharing takes place, that couldn’t have been possible otherwise.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>To find new jobs</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/Online-Portfolio.jpg" alt="Online-Portfolio">
                    <h3>This is one of the newer reasons why people create a blog. Let’s say you’re a programmer who is skilled in creating websites, you could create a blog and start posting about programming-related topics. This will help drive potential future employers to your site who might want to hire you for a project. Or maybe you’re a photographer. You can start a blog on your website with all of your pictures to try and draw in people from search engines. This is actually a very effective way of finding jobs.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>To help others</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/helping-others-post-it-note.jpg" alt="helping-others-post-it-note" style="width: 30%;">
                    <h3>A lot of blogs are written to help people going through a certain phase or circumstances. Like break-ups, disease, parenting, depression and so on. It is difficult to talk to someone personally on these topics. Such blogs work therapeutically for many people. It also makes them feel that they are the only one going through such a phase, but there are so many others who are going through the same situation.</h3>
                    <h3><li><strong>To gain Knowledge</strong></li></h3>
                    <img src="/images/images.jfif" alt="images" style="width: 50%;">
                    <h3>I started this article with “To share knowledge”, and adding this again, as a lot of forward-thinking individuals, actually blog to gain new knowledge. There are almost half a million blogs available on the web, they cover almost every topic. One can gain and share information on the topic of interest. Updating blogs regularly with the latest information is a perfect way to stay abreast of the events in a specific field or topic. There are certain things, which are to be kept in mind while writing a blog. A blog should be updated regularly with the latest information otherwise, is considered as a static web page for the readers.</h3>
