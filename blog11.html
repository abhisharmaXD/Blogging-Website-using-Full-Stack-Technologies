                    <h3>WordPress is a memory-hogging CMS. To ensure WordPress doesn’t make your web server crash, use a cache plugin along with powerful servers such as Bluehost or Kinsta. There are many excellent WordPress cache plugins out there, but WP-Rocket tops every one of them for its simplicity and effectiveness. What more, it works great even on shared hosting! Whenever a user browses your blog post, WordPress has to fetch that post from the WordPress database. Now, this process needs far too many PHP calls and thus put a lot of strain on your hosting server.</h3>
