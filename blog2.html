                <h3>Among Bloggers and people who love acquiring information from the Internet, RSS feed must not be a new word, but for many, it’s a Jargon. Today, we will learn about RSS feeds and how it’s useful for everyone to stay updated with news. And also for bloggers that why you can’t afford to miss offering RSS as a subscription option.</h3>
                <h3>The most common icon used for RSS feed is in the orange color and most common placement of the same is in the sidebar or around blog post. It’s also called as feed or web feed.</h3>

                <h3>On WordPress, you get feed feature by default, but it’s not so user-friendly. One natural step is to burn your feed using Feedburner and you can also enable features like Email subscription which will be very helpful. For any blogger, it’s very important to offer RSS updates, and the most common placement for feed icon is on the sidebar or on the navbar.</h3>
