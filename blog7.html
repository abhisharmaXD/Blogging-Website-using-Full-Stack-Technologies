                <h3>With regard to SEO, much has changed in the last couple of years, but one thing that remains the same is the backlink. Formerly, your site would rank higher based on the number of backlinks you’ve gotten, but in 2020 it’s all about how many quality links you have. Last year, Google’s Penguin algorithm update killed all the private blog networks and devalued the low-quality links. In this tutorial, I will be discussing some of the best online backlink checker websites you can use to check how many backlinks your website has gotten.</h3>
                <h2>Why you need backlink checker tools?</h2>
                <h3>When any website links to your site or any page of your site from its website, this is called backlinks. Backlinks used to be one of the most important parameters for high page ranking and better keyword ranking. However, with time, Google demoted the priority of backlinks and added more signals to rank a website.  Backlinks are usually categorized in two ways: Dofollow backlinks and no follow backlinks. When we talk about creating backlinks, we usually concentrate on creating dofollow links. Using backlink checker tools, we count how many backlinks we have created for our site. A good number of backlinks helps immensely in increasing the domain authority and also the Moz rank of our site. Following are some free online backlink checker tools that will help you to see all the incoming backlinks to your website. You can select any one of these tools based on your requirements. Some of them offer detailed results while others offer only the number of backlinks, but none of them requires registration or sign up that makes the process quick and easy!</h3>
