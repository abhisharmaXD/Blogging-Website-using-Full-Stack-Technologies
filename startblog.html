                    </ul>
                </h3>
                <h3>In this guide, you will find answers to all these questions and will be able to start a blog. Here are the steps to start a blog:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Picking the blog topic</li>
                        <li>Select the blogging platform</li>
                        <li>Pick a domain name & hosting for your blog</li>
                        <li>Install WordPress on the blog</li>
                        <li>Setup the design of the blog</li>
                        <li>Install the best WordPress plugins</li>

                        <li>Share your writeup with the world</li>
                        <li>Monetize your blog</li>
                        <li>Monetize your blog</li>
                    </ol>
                </h3>
                <h2>Picking the blog topic</h2>
                <h3>The very first thing you need to do is find the niche of your blog. By niche, I mean finding a topic that your blog is going to be about. I hope you don’t plan to blog about every random thing and make money. This doesn’t work in 2020 and your chances of success are better when you blog on a single topic. You might be a jack of all trades, and want to start a blog on multiple topics, but it will not be fruitful, as people like to subscribe to a blog, which is an authority on a particular topic.</h3>
                <h2>Select the blogging platform</h2>
                <h3>The first answer you should have is, where should you create your blog? There are many blogging platforms out there, and people have different opinions about each of them. Most of the Bloggers start blogging on the WordPress platform. WordPress is popular because it’s easy to use. Here is an interesting fact: 37% of the websites in the world is powered by WordPress. Once you have crossed the testing period, you are ready to do something more meaningful. Get a WordPress blog, and don’t confuse yourself with WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress -blog. A self-hosted WordPress blog (WordPress.org) is what you need.</h3>
                <h2>Pick a Blog name & domain name for your blog</h2>
                <h3>There are 4 rules that I usually follow when picking a domain name:
                    <ol>
                        <li><i>Easy to Remember</i></li>
                        <li><i>Easy to Type</i></li>
                        <li><i>Easy to Pronounce</i></li>
                        <li><i>Easy to Brandable</i></li>
                    </ol>
                A domain name is the URL of a blog which a visitor will use to open a blog. Now, there are a few rules which will help you to pick the best name for your new blog. Here are some of the tips from my experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prefer .com domain name above everything else.</li>
                        <li>Your domain name should be easy to pronounce and easy to type.</li>
                        <li>Make sure your domain name should not be confusing to the listener.</li>
                    </ul>
                You can use Bluehost domain suggestion feature to check if your domain name is available or not. Simply enter any word that you have picked for your blog and it will also show you available domain name suggestions. Name of your blog very crucial in my opinion. You can also have a domain name under your own name, and its great for personal portfolio or if you planning to make yourself a brand. However, I prefer having a generic name so that in future I could have people running it, and I could enjoy the benefit of solopreneurship.
                </h3>
                <h2>Picking the hosting to start the blog:</h2>
                <h3>Web-hosting is where WordPress will be installed. This is a server which stays online 24*7 and all your future blog images, your blog design and everything will be stored on this server (hosting). That is how your website will be up and running 24*7. The good thing is, hostings are cheap. There are plenty of hosting service providers but for your blog:</h3>
                <h3>Bluehost is the idlest choice as it offers everything you need to create a blog. Features like:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Free SSL</li>
                        <li>Unlimited bandwidth</li>
                        <li>Unlimited storage</li>
                        <li>Free domain name (Saving of $12/year)</li>
                        <li>Easy to use cPanel.</li>

                    </ul>
                <img src="/images/Select-blog-plan.png" alt="Select Blog Plan">
                </h3>
                <h2>Set up your blog</h2>
                <h3>The best thing about Bluehost is, it will automatically install the blog for you. However, you are not done, as you need to complete a few things before you will write your first blog post. To start setting up your blog for branding and make it perfect, I have shared some guides which you can refer to get started:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="installwordpress.html">Learn how to set up a WordPress blog for the first time.</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </h3>
                <h2>Design of your blog</h2>
                <h3>“<strong>The first impression is the last impression</strong>”, that’s the mantra we follow for a blog.</h3>
                <h3>Blog design is the most important aspect of your blog because a good design will ensure that your visitors will love your blog. In fact, that is how your readers will remember your blog. Imagine your blog design as you with a nice outfit. In WordPress, there is a concept called “WordPress themes”. These are ready-made designs that are available for all types of blog. There are many Free and premium WordPress themes out there. I always recommend to go for a premium theme because you will get all the support and starter guide, and moreover, you will have a quality design for your blog.</h3>

                <h2>WordPress plugins</h2>
                <h3>There are thousands of WordPress plugins out there. Below I have mentioned only those plugins which you should install from day one. Here are plugins which you should have on your newly created WordPress blog:
                    <ul>

                        <li>ShortPixels</li>
                        <li>Jetpack by WordPress.com</li>
                    </ul>
                There are many more plugins, but the above plugins will ensure that you have all the basics plugin installed on your blog. If you have followed, all the steps until now, your blog is up and ready. Now, comes the part which you should be doing over the period of time and that is adding new content.
                </h3>
                <h2>Plan your content</h2>
                <h3>
                Before you start writing your first blog post, you should make a content plan. You can use an excel or use a Trello board. Here is a free Trello content planning board that you could use.</h3>
                <img src="/images/Free-Content-planning-board.png" alt="Content planning">

                        <li>When you are writing your content, imagine there is a person sitting next to you, and you are talking to the person. Write in the first person tone, because there is a single person who is reading your blog. For example, you are reading this blog post alone. That is why you might notice, my tone is “I” and “You”.</li>
                        <li>Your content should cover all the aspects of the topic you are writing about. Feel free to write 1000+ words.</li>
