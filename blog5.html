                    </ul>
                </h3>
                <h3>Note: Due to Twitter API limitations, you could delete only recent 3200 tweets, and to delete tweets older than that, you need to use the Twitter history archive deletion method that I have explained in the further section of this tutorial.</h3>
                <h3>Once you are logged into Circleboom dashboard:</h3>
                <img src="/images/How-to-Delete-Old-tweets.jpg" alt="Delete Old tweets">
                <h3>Now, on this page you can use the search feature to find tweets you want to delete. Or you can simply, delete all tweets in bulk and within minutes.</h3>
                <h2>How to Delete Twitter likes and Retweet?</h2>

                <h2>How to delete old tweets from archive?</h2>
                <h3>As I said earlier, using the above method you could delete only recent 3200 tweets, likes or retweets.</h3>

                <h3>If you need to delete tweets which are tweeted a loooong time back? How could you search your twitter account for tweets and delete them? Well, this is where you take help of a feature called “Twitter archive”</h3>
                <img src="/images/Delete-Twitter-history-archive.jpg" alt="Twitter Archive">
                <h3>This feature let you create a backup of your Twitter history, that you could download. You could use it for multiple purpose, but in this case, we will use it to search and select either all of our Tweets, or selected tweets from our account.</h3>
