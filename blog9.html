                <h3>No matter what your WordPress website is about, you need a contact form so that your visitors can get in touch with you. To help you add a contact form to your site, I’ve gone hands-on with 5 different WordPress contact form plugins. From simple plugins for basic contact forms to more advanced plugins that can help you accept payments and a whole lot more, you’ll be able to find the right tool for your website on this list.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <h2><li><strong>WPForms</strong></li></h2>
                    <img src="/images/WPForms-1024x820.jpg" alt="WPForms">
                    <h3>Active on over 1 million websites, WPForms is one of the most popular contact form plugins at WordPress.org. Beyond the very popular free version that makes a good option for contact forms, there are also a few different premium versions that will let you use forms to collect payments, sign people up to your email list, plus more.</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drag-and-drop form builder</li>
                        <li>View form submissions in WordPress dashboard</li>
                        <li>Anti-spam features (honeypot field and CAPTCHA)</li>
                        <li>Custom confirmation message or redirect</li>
                    </ul>
                    </h3>
                    <h2><li><strong>Formidable Forms</strong></li></h2>
                    <img src="/images/screenshot-4.png" alt="Formidable Forms">
                    <h3>Formidable Forms is another popular WordPress form plugin that comes in a free version at WordPress.org, as well as various pro versions.</h3>
                    <h3>While you can certainly use Formidable Forms for a simple contact form, this plugin really excels when you get into creating more complex types of forms. For example, maybe you want to let people submit a rating as part of the form, or purchase something. That’s where Formidable Forms does well.</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drag-and-drop form builder</li>
                        <li>View form submissions in WordPress dashboard</li>
                        <li>13 field types in free version</li>
                        <li>Style options</li>
                    </ul>
                    </h3>
                    <h2><li><strong>Contact Form 7</strong></li></h2>
                    <img src="/images/screenshot-1.png" alt="Formidable Forms">
                    <h3>Contact Form 7 is one of the oldest, most popular contact form plugins in existence. By itself, I don’t think it’s as good an option as many of the other tools on this list. The form builder interface is not drag-and-drop, and it’s probably the least user-friendly of any of the contact form plugins on this list.</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>14 field types to choose from</li>
                        <li>Email notifications</li>
                        <li>Custom confirmation messages</li>
                        <li>Style options</li>
                    </ul>
                    </h3>
                    <h2><li><strong>HappyForms</strong></li></h2>
                    <img src="/images/screenshot-14.jpg" alt="HappyForms">
                    <h3>HappyForms is the simplest, most limited contact form plugin on this list. However, if all you want to do is make a simple contact form, that simplicity is actually a good thing as it makes it very easy to create your form. HappyForms is also 100% free, which is another attractive feature of this contact form plugin.</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Embed forms anywhere on your WordPress site</li>
                        <li>Anti-spam functionality via honeypot fields and/or Google ReCaptcha</li>
                        <li>19 different field types that you can use to build your forms</li>
                        <li>Redirect users to a custom page after they submit the form</li>
                    </ul>
                    </h3>
                    <h2><li><strong>Ninja Forms</strong></li></h2>
                    <img src="/images/screenshot-1 (1).png" alt="Ninja Forms">
                    <h3>Ninja Forms is another popular WordPress contact form plugin with a great visual drag-and-drop builder. Like WPForms, you can create basic contact forms for free, but then the paid versions also offer a lot of extra functionality, like payment processing, email marketing, and a lot more. However, whereas WPForms only offers a few different premium versions, Ninja Forms lets you pick-and-choose individual add-ons as needed.</h3>
                    <h3><strong>Key Features</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>20+ different field types, even in the free version</li>
                        <li>View form submissions in WordPress dashboard</li>
                        <li>Anti-spam functionality, including reCAPTCHA</li>
                        <li>Drag-and-drop form builder</li>
